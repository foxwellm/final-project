# Vue Mini Project
This was a 2 day mini project to try out a new language we had no previous experience with, Vue. The assignment was to create a one page application using the Harvard Art Museum API. The app I build will show 3 random images from the museum image API. There is a cycle button that will display 3 new images when clicked.

## Setup Instructions


get an API key from [Harvard Art Museum API key request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkmEBqH76HLMMiCC-GPPnhcvHC9aJS86E32dOd0Z8MpY2rvQ/viewform)
